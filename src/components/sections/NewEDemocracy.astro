      <p>In 2018, a project of mine at DAE culminated in a film called: "Noi Contro Loro". It was about how a far-right politician in Italy used social media to present an authentic imago, all the while optimising their posts to maximise traction. I realised that part of what made the politcian succesful was that they proudly displayed attacks against them and they profited from they chaos they themselves engineered - They were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility">antifragile</a>. Instead of contribute to the cacophony by publishing the film, I realised that working on the hidden layer - the root cause - might be more productive.</p>

      <p>The first low-fi prototype was designed to probe how people might use such a random database of recordings. It took the form of a website called Random Radio, and while it worked as intended, I didn't explore the idea further.</p>

      <p>I confess to feeling a little missunderstood, but I understood the critique: the project was fun, but didn't communicate the essense of the research. I went back to the drawing board.</p>

      <p>People around me kept making allusions to chaos, a lack of structure. Randomness couldn't be a useful tool because it was chaotic. I picked up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos:_Making_a_New_Science">a book titled CHAOS</a>, and started reading. I soon realised that randomness was NOT chaotic.</p>

      <p>One of the concepts explored in the book was the barnsely fern, where a short set of transformation rules, iterated over at random, produced a fractal pattern. I iterated over the rule set in other, non random ways, and never got the same result. I reaslised that randomness has some special characterisitic that allowed the fractal structure to emerge.</p>

They are sets of vector transformations that can generate fractal letterforms at quasi-infinite resolution.</p>

      <p class="mt-4">Chaos scientists in the 1980's developed a technique called reccurence plotting, that allowed them to find higher order structure in chaotic systems. I recreated these reccurence plots for a number of systems, including a simple random number generator, and what struck me was this: with randomness, you can see the boundary of the canvas! Large numbers of random inputs allow you to be sure that the structure of the output is reflecting the structure of the higher order system (the plot), rather than some prior bias (the function).</p>

      <p>Going back to the drawing board (killing my darlings) allowed me to make a second serendipitous connection: Scientists and engineers use randomisation all the time! Exactly for the reason that large numbers of randomly selected inputs act as a kind of blank canvas, an egalitarian sampling method that breaks information feedback loops that cause bias and allows for the exploration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system">complex systems.</a></p>
